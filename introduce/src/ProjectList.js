        description: 'This is a simple Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" and "O". The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. Deployed the application on Netlify, ensuring continuous updates and smooth deployment.'
